# Hummingbot Dashboard

Collection of data visualization and analysis Hummingbot-related dashboards. The dashboards helps you run and manage Hummingbot, analyze performance, analyze trade data, and much more!

Dashboard is built using [StreamLit](https://streamlit.io/) and uses the Conda environment & package manager to simiplify installation, updates, and manage dependencies. 

You will need to install [StreamLit](https://streamlit.io/). For information about Streamlit installation, see the instructions located at https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation.

You will also need to install either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to get Conda:
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is a comprehensive Python distribution that includes a large number of pre-installed data science libraries and packages. It is designed to be an all-in-one solution for data science and machine learning tasks. When you install Anaconda, it comes with a collection of popular Python packages like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and more. 
* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is a minimal version of Anaconda. It includes only the essential components, such as Python interpreter and Conda package manager. Unlike Anaconda, Miniconda doesn't come with pre-installed packages, which makes its download size much smaller. 

This repository is maintained by Hummingbot Foundation as a companion for users of [Hummingbot](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot), the open source framework for building high-frequency crypto trading bots.

## Dashboards

Here are the current dashboards in the collection:

### ðŸš€ Strategy Performance (WIP)

Dashboard that helps you analyze the performance of a running Hummingbot instance

### ðŸ§™ XE Token Analyzer

Dashboard that helps you visualize the bid-ask spread and volume of different tokens across the crypto exchange landscape. 

This app is most helpful for Hummingbot users running the [Cross-Exchange Market Making](https://hummingbot.org/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/) and [Arbitrage](https://hummingbot.org/strategies/arbitrage/) strategies.

### ðŸ§³ Hummingbot DB

Inspect and analyze the orders and trades data contained in a SQLite database for a strategy or script. 

These files are located in the `/data` folder in Hummingbot, and are named `<strategy_name>.sqlite`.

### ðŸ¦‰ TVL vs MCAP Analysis

Easily compare various DeFi protocols based on their market capitalization and total value locked, using DeFiLlama data.

### ðŸ—‚ Candles Downloader

Download historical exchange data as OHLVC candles. Supports multiple trading pairs and custom time ranges/intervals.

Current Hummingbot connectors supported:
* `binance`
* `binance_perpetual`

## Installation

1. Install Steamlit and Conda packages utilizing their instructions for your specific environment:
* Install  [StreamLit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation)
* Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. Clone this repo and navigate to the created directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard.git
cd dashboard
```

3. Run conda command to create an isolated `conda` environment and install dependencies
```
conda env create -f environment_conda.yml
```

4. Activate the isoldated 'conda' environment
```bash
conda activate dashboard
```

5. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## Data Feed

Your `dashboard` environment needs to have access to the database for your Hummingbot environment. This is done by setting up a symbolic link to the 'data' directory of your running Hummingbot instance. 

The data directory differs for Docker versus Source installed Hummingbot. Data directory for each is as follows:
* Docker installed: /path/to/hummingbot/hummingbot_files/data
* Source installed: /path/to/hummingbot/data


Create a symlink to your Hummingbot `/data` directory
```bash
# replace `/path/to/hummingbotdata` with the actual path
ln -s /path/to/hummingbotdata data

# if you need to remove the symlink
unlink data
```



## Updates

To update the `dashboard` environment for new dependencies, run:
```
conda env update -f environment_conda.yml
```

To updated the `dashboard` source for latest version, run:
```
cd dashboard
git pull
```
